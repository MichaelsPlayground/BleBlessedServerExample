# BLE Blessed Client sample

This is a sample app build with the BLE library **Blessed-Android**.

The library is available here: https://github.com/weliem/blessed-android

A complex sample is included and this app is a smaller version but with some more 
access to the data (or better the BLE device).

If you need a BLE Client (or peripheral) the library supports this as well, a sample app is 
available here: https://github.com/weliem/blessed-android.

If you should need more information on how to setup a peripheral see here:

A BLE Glucose device is available here:
